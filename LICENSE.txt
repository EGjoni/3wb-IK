1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

  * In the case of source code redistribution, the text of this license is sufficient.

  * In the case of any packaged, compiled, or other user-facing redistribution, the name or logo of this project or library and/or its authors must appear among any user-facing sections dedicated to the purposes of crediting or acknowledging the involvement or contributions of third parties if any such sections exist.

  * In the case of use for any academic or research publications, this project's repository and its authors must appear in the citations section in whatever manner or format allowed or preferred by the publication.

The primary intent of this license is to maximize exposure for the original project in the hopes that downstream users may benefit from contributions that would otherwise be limited to the tools that make use of it. The secondary intent of this license is to credit the developers so that they can get jobs. All clauses should be interpreted with the general spirit of these two intents in mind.
